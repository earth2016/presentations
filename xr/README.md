# Extended (virtual & augmented) reality in the browser

New standards, supported by most modern browsers,
allow for building virtual reality and augmented
reality scenes and applications.

## Virtual reality

Browsers provide WebVR, based on WebGL.

Building stuff:

* [Geometry](examples/vr/vr-1.html)
  ([code](https://github.com/jgbarah/presentations/tree/master/xr/examples/vr/vr-1.html)).

* [Robots in the fog](examples/vr/vr-2.html)
  ([code](https://github.com/jgbarah/presentations/tree/master/xr/examples/vr/vr-2.html)).

* [Robots in the fog (URJC edition)](examples/vr/vr-3.html)
  ([code](https://github.com/jgbarah/presentations/tree/master/xr/examples/vr/vr-2.html)).

* [AFrame](https://aframe.io)

* [AFrame Playground](https://jgbarah.github.io/aframe-playground/)

## Augmented reality

Building stuff:

* [Something is moving near you](examples/ar/ar-1.html)
  ([code](https://github.com/jgbarah/presentations/tree/master/xr/examples/ar/ar-1.html)).
  Check this one with a mobile, be sure you allow the camera to work,
  and point it to the marker.
  
* [There be robots...](examples/ar/ar-2.html)
  ([code](https://github.com/jgbarah/presentations/tree/master/xr/examples/ar/ar-2.html)).
  Check this one with a mobile, be sure you allow the camera to work,
  and point it to the marker.
